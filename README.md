## Daisy Pepper

Daisy Pepper is a simple e-commerce website concept for selling jewelry. It was my very first university project, created entirely with HTML and CSS. The website presents a clean and minimalistic layout to showcase products, with sections for browsing jewelry and learning more about the brand.

Although basic in functionality, Daisy Pepper represents the very beginning of my journey into web development. I keep this project in my portfolio to remind myself how far I’ve come since those first steps.

## Summary
Daisy Pepper may not include JavaScript, databases, or advanced interactivity — but it was the foundation of my learning in web development. Today, I build more complex, dynamic applications, but this project will always be a reminder of where it all started.
